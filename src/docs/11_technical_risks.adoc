| Problems creating pods with Solid to decentralize the application instead of creating a unified database | Almost all the code implemented by the memebers of the group to manage data has been done through a centralized database | Perform small tests with a Solid pod
| Inexperience to realize a project without a recommended architecture | In great part of the projects realized by the members of the team we were indicated more or less the tools to use | To find the best tools to speed up the process of codification
