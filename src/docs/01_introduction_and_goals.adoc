== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Our goal is to create DeChat, a descentralized chat app based on the https://solid.inrupt.com/[solid] specifications. This project will be developed by a team of five members.
****

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
The main objective is to ensure that the data does not pass through a central server, so each user saves its own data.
Therefore the system will be based on a decentralized architecture where the
data storage is separated from the application.

.Essential features

* Users can store their chat data in their own pods.
* The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat.
* A user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him.
* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat.
* It will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages.
* Other optional features are:
** Users can have live calls and videos.
** Users can share their screens in the chat.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.
